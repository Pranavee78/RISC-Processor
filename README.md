This project implements a 3-stage pipelined RISC processor using Verilog, designed to perform fundamental arithmetic, logic, and memory operations with a clean modular architecture and synchronous control logic.
## Features
- **RISC architecture** with a minimal custom instruction set  
- **3-stage pipeline**: Instruction Fetch, Decode, and Execute  
- **Modular design**: ALU, register file, control unit, and memory  
- **Supports** arithmetic, logical, and memory access instructions  
- **Clean instruction decoding** and control signal generation  
- **Synchronous execution** with clock-driven, hazard-free operation
